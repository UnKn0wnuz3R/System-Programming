Enhance the shell to support piping, allowing for the execution of complex command sequences where the output of one command serves as the input to another.

Before executing the program:

Input 'make' in bash to compile the program.

HOW TO Execute:

Following commands support piping:

"ls", "grep", "cat", "less", "sort", "echo", "tail", "ps"
Use the pipe | operator to pass the output of one command as the input to another.
Example Commands with Piping:

Example :
'ls -al | grep "filename" '
' cat filename | sort | less '


Exiting the shell:
Input "quit" or "exit" to quit myshell.
